# How to create a chest shop to sell items?
Make sure you are a Settler! If you are a Traveler, you need to rank up first. Use /rankup.
1. First, you have to (partially) own a company. To create a company, use `/create company`, and click the link. Read through the contract and attach a fictional signature on the page.
2. Place down a chest or barrel and put the item you want to sell into that container.
3. Place a sign around it (above, attached to, next to, or below the container), with this on the sign:
   - line 1: leave empty (however, if you own multiple companies, you can put the company name here)
   - line 2: the amount of item you want to sell per transaction
   - line 3: the price of the item(s) per transaction
   - line 4: ? (a question mark, it will be replaced with the item ID of the item in the container)

If you want to buy items from players, you have to prefix the number on line 3 with an 'S'. You will then also need to deposit coins into your company by doing `/company <name> deposit <coins>`. These coins will then be used to pay for the items people sell to your shop. When the company's balance runs out, others will be unable to sell to your company.

*Note that if you own more than 20 chest shops, your sales will be taxed. More about that at survival.rocks/guides/tax-system.*
